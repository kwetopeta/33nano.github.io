<p>Welcome to my Blog! My name is Prince Kaizen Namwali, an Afropolitan from the warm heart of Africa üá≤üáº. I am a <strong>Lifelong Learner, Digital Nomad &amp; Game Dev.</strong> Whats my story?</p>

<p>My story has a fuzzy timeline, but its safe to say that it started with a course, that I purchased on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>, entitled <em>REBT The Science of Programming Your Mind,</em> which can be found right <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/rebt-psychology-self-help/">here</a>. Till this day, I can vividly recall the details of that course and continue to experience the positive impact that its had. The timing couldn&rsquo;t have been any  perfect because I took this course, while I was in high school. High school proved to be a fun experience for me thanks to my involvement in the choir, Earth club, track &amp; field, and makerspace. However, despite taking that course and my involvement in extracurricular activities; Standardized tests made me skeptical about reality. I instinctively used the teachings of that course through my reflection. As i pondered, these questions became the focal point of my reticular activating system:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is College the only way?</li>
<li>How can I learn faster?</li>
<li>Why do people struggle with money?</li>
</ol>

<p>Academia, learning and finance - why should a high schooler or anybody be concerned with such trivial matters? Well, the reality is school makes up a large chunk of a persons life, learning is not something you do in school and money is this quintessial thing that determines the quality of a persons life. These topics are vital and addressing them early on is key. I had questions, but i couldn&rsquo;t find the answers through school, so i turned to life and the internet.
I found the answer to my first question through various sources and people. 2 Books: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34334773-forward-tilt">Forward Tilt</a> by <a href="https://isaacmorehouse.com/">Isaac Morehouse</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/45987369-skip-college">Skip College</a> by <a href="https://connorboyack.com/">Conor Boyack</a>. I learned about this awesome alternative, but its really about making You, your own credential - its called <a href="https://discoverpraxis.com/">Praxis</a>. While i never attended Praxis, I read their blog frequently. The final piece of the puzzle manifested itself, when I took the time to analyze the language of <strong>Dropouts</strong> and <strong>Optouts</strong>. The key words are: <strong>Self taught</strong>, <strong>Apprentice</strong> and <strong>Intern</strong>. These keywords are synonymous with  professions like programmer, musician, carpenter, photographer and etc. Try using those keywords with professions like doctor, thats not possible because the government literally requires you to get a license. Any profession that doesnt require a license thats mandated by the government and as long as those keywords can be applied does not require higher education. In summary college is not the only way, you have options.</p>

<p>I found the answer to my second question, upon accidentally discovering a podcast called <em>Kwik Brain</em> by the Brain coach, <a href="https://www.jimkwik.com/">Jim Kwik</a>. I was intrigued by this concept of metalearning and using various tricks for memory mastery. I still listen to the podcast today, read his blog and have read his book entitled, <em><a href="https://www.limitlessbook.com/">Limitless</a></em>. Aside from the podcast, i delved into reading books about the Brain and memory. In particular these books come in mind: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16158493-the-first-20-hours?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=HO2VgzWRo3&amp;rank=1">First 20 Hours:How to Learn Anything&hellip;Fast</a> by <a href="https://joshkaufman.net/">Josh Kaufman</a> ,<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20958539-unlimited-memory">Unlimited Memory</a> by <a href="https://www.memorabletraining.com/">Kevin Horsley</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/38233396-mind-map-mastery">Mindmap Mastery</a> by <a href="https://tonybuzan.com/">Tony Buzan</a>. Learning faster involves first learning about how you learn and experimenting with different techniques to see what works best. I was satisfied with the results, that I had found and put them into practice, but i also learned of something known as Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). I am simply aware of what it is and how its similar to something called Transient Hypofrontality (flow state). Anyways, thats as far as my curiosity goes because I dont want to be reading medical journals on Neuroscience or experimeting with Brain wearables (tDCS, EEG).</p>

<p>I found the answer to my third question through one of the greatest financial educators, Robert Kiyosaki. A multitude of people know him from his infamous and undisputed financial book of all time <em>Rich Dad, Poor Dad.</em> I have read most of his books and my personal favorite would have to be <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40385517-fake">Fake: Fake Money, Fake Teachers and Fake Assets: How Lies Are Making the Poor and Middle Class Poorer</a>. I listen to his podcast, the rich dad show, on a regular basis and i&rsquo;m a frequest visitor of the rich dad <a href="https://www.richdad.com/">website</a>. I also love the book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/9512985-the-personal-mba">Personal MBA</a> by <a href="https://joshkaufman.net/">Josh Kaufman</a>.</p>

<p>Is that it? No, lets see&hellip; I&rsquo;m gonna go back to my tagline: Lifelong Learner, Digital Nomad &amp; Game Developer, with a bit of more emphasis on the first 2. I love learning and i&rsquo;m well versed with technology like every other typical Generation Z. The topics that I find interesting include Procedural Generation, Personal Knowledge Management, Modular Synthesis, Brain Health, Guided Meditation, Spoken Word Poetry, Biohacking, Neuro Linguistic Programming, Linux Ricing, Human Languages, Manhwa, Mental Models, Gamification, Decentralized Applications &amp; Minimalism. There is more, but thats its for this about page. Feel free to read my blog posts. I need to update my content more often!</p>
