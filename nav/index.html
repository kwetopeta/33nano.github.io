<p>Write what you want to read <!-- The landscape carved by the scribe is bountiful and full of vigor. To my surprise i was unable to find titles or content written on things that i was curious about. I wish someone could or had created this content, but instead of wishful thinking i knew something could be done. I picked up my text editor and bashed away keys on the keyboard to bring the content that i wish i could read into existence. Write what you want to read is one the best pieces of advice given to scribes and for a damn good reason... --></p>

    <p>Life is difficult and that is a fact. Change happens one day at a time and that&#39;s that. Life is difficult and that is a fact. We think and then we feel, that&#39;s that. Life is difficult and that is a fact. Practice makes progress and there is no substitute for that. Life is difficult and that is a fact. Learning should be fun, thank TDCS,Gaming and Neuroscience for that. Life is difficult and that is a fact. Ask and learn, if you don&#39;t know, eat healthy or it will show. Life is difficult and that is a fact. You can do anything and your Brain knows that. Life is difficult and that is a fact. Keep learning and your Brain will remain intact</p>
