        <p>Comfort and Laziness have been my longest business partners, since the dawn of time. This site looks empty because <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> is generous enough to have a <code>draft = true</code> <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/">Front Matter</a>. In the meantime, I made some super cool placeholder titles and I&rsquo;ll leave you with this awesome art manifesto by Austin Kleon -</p>
<p><em>Draw the art you want to see, start the business you want to run, play the music you want to hear, write the books you want to read, build the products you want to use – do the work you want to see done</em>. <!-- The landscape carved by the scribe is bountiful and full of vigor. To my surprise i was unable to find titles or content written on things that i was curious about. I wish someone could or had created this content, but instead of wishful thinking i knew something could be done. I picked up my text editor and bashed away keys on the keyboard to bring the content that i wish i could read into existence. Write what you want to read is one the best pieces of advice given to scribes and for a damn good reason... --></p>

<!-- Comment Dump

1. 2022 started out crazy, but my resolution remained Self Employment. One of the craziest things i learned early on was the fact that slavery in America never ended. The 13th amendment permits slavery through a person serving their sentence. And if we know anything about America its that mass incarceration, police genocide and media plays a huge part in destroying the black image. It was even crazier to learn about the true history of Slavery. It dates back to the biblical days apparently. Slavery is a human problem, not exactly uniquely American.

2. In the year 2022 i was tempted to start sugar dating &/ using the Adult Friend Finder app to hookup with people. All it takes is a gift card or a visa debit card, but i decided early on in January to remain celibate, like i always have, except this time i go hardcore (no PMO). A complete reboot of the psyche. Desperation is dangerous. Even if the Omicron variant never took a toll on my body, it took a toll on my finances. A friend stuck in Malawi, the man of the house stuck in Malawi, A -40 account balance in thine account. -500 account balance from a distant cousin. Just wild stuff

3. The stydytogether discord server sucks, so i left

4. A bookworm is mightier than the earthworm

5. 108F is the name of the studio @TheLab45

6. Imagine going to a restaurant and only ordering water. While you are there you order food from another restaurant through doordash and dine there. Other guests would be confused and this is probably the easiest way to get banned from a restaurant. This joke would kill in a standup comedy stage. So, i took this girl out that i jsut met on tinder to fancy restaurant because her looks were obviously a 10 and just couldnt see her eat at cheap restaurant. The waitress comes along and we order our drinks. I start looking at the menu and the number looked all fuzzy. I started reading with my fingers 1,2 3 digits. Nothing on the menu was a double digit, except the drinks. She ordered her share, while i passed. I was still hungry, so i ordered some food through doordash while at this restaurant. My food arrived way before hers. Anyways long story i got banned from the restarant, but at least we split the bill.

7. This will probaby be my new tagline/summary for dating apps: A content writer looking for new experiences to write about. Nocturnal emissions are what keep me up at night, Im a night owl that howls like the wolves and sleeps at the sound of the rooster.

8. Tldr and Tldw have become some of my favorite acronyms. Tldr particularly applies to academic/research journals and papers. These mediums take too long to get to the point, something that blogs and listicles achieve with relative ease. Tldw is something that i find myself using more often. Its something that i didnt know i used all the time because i quit watching anime (time waster) and i will never get into any tv series, whether its animated, live action, popular, good. Someone will eventually summarize that stuff. Tldw i find myself applying towards African music videos, Its just way too long. Why not just make it a musical, so that i know to avoid it before you bore me to death. Malawi TV, especially the videos posted on YouTube are just way too damn long and the worst part is that the quality straight up sucks. I wouldnt mind an audio format like a podcast because thats about the only medium that makes sense to be in long form. Tldw is the new driving principle behind how i spend time on youtube now, compared to before. If its too long, just find a blog to extract info form, if the blog sucks - read the documentation, thats what its for.

9. Peers with accolades (friends with benefits)

10. Videos are not a subtitute for documentation. therefore youtube is not a subtitute for documentantion. Document is friend that cares, her size will never be gigantic. She overflows with knowledge and she can share her secrets if you use the magic keyword Ctrl + F. She is self contained. 

11. Age is just a number, so is a prison sentence (a joke from Korean Comic - when your friend simps for anime characters)

12. Unknown P's Pain au chocolat sounds like main squeeze by Unknown T

13. Learn all there is to know about slavery from freetheslaves.net

14. Making faceless content is more technical.
- Glasses/mask /masquarade
- Vtuber/ Mocap
- Slideshows
- stock footage + narrated with music
- POV / VR
- Screen recording
- Animation (Doodle, freelance)
- Text on screen (lyric videos, #Aegisub)

15. Community service is the fancy term used in America to mask the real world, Slavery

16. Ending up in jail/prison in USA as a black person is sentence to slavery

17. The best purchase i made thus far in 2022 is a sleep mask. Not one of those cheap ones with a string, No! This one has an adjustable thick strap. It wont be breaking any time soon and the countours really stick to the eyes. 

18. Quote by Robert A Heinlein: A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, buttcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balence accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects

19. I for sure as hell need to make my own dictionary for the SDCV command line dictionary (Stardict). I have to read the documentation and look at examples. Ideally i would love a dictionary for my phone that allows this sort of customizability. 

20. To change the narrative, we must first change the language. Be the change, you wish to see in the world. 

21. If i played the word association game, almost all my answers would match others. When i think success i picture people like Jeff Bezos, elon Musk. All my answers are white. I have been whitewashed. Its time to change that narrative. I didnt know watching a niche history about latin people by John Guillermo would have so much impact. Finding a latin hero was...

22. Munya Chawawa looks like DL Hughley

23. Convert my second brain notes to Asciidoc (.adoc) 

24. Voclio is a marketplace for vocals. I need to record and upload 5 high quality vocal tracks. People download the vocals not the instrumental. I can reuse my instrumentals and just record vocals. Lets aim for February 2022 or until the next time i go to the studio. You gotta have BPM, Key, Mood, Genre and all that. There is a streaming file and the actual download file. 

25. Man, ASCII art is sexy, i need to spend more time i the terminal and figure out a way to use it. Heck, i would be interesting in experimenting with it. Animation? We'll see. https://www.gridsagegames.com/rexpaint/gallery.html

26. Now that i think about it. Zines are kind of similar to non fungible tokens

27. I would love to write a post about adult friend finder on this blog, but i will probably just save those efforts for a Figma redesign that i will upload to Dribbbble instead. 

28. Granola >> 2 cups of oats, 2 tablespoons of honey, 1 tablespoon peanut butter, 2 tablespoons of extra virgin oil, 2 tablespoons of raisins, 2 tablespoons peanuts, 1 ripe banana, 1/2 teaspoon of salt. mix dry ingredients separately. Microwave liquid mix and ovenat 350F. 

29. The internet is bloated. trying to find a recipe is fucking tedious process of going through bloat.

30. The scariest part of being a house sitter in America is going to a house of a gun owner. If they're not in there right mind youre a target. This seems like exxageration or fantasy, but in America its possible. 

31. Add a favicon to this website

32. Get a knowledge panel. Create wikipedia & Wikidata page. Meta tags on your site. 

33. Discipline - The ability to do what you dont want to do, when it has to be done, whether you like it or not 
Runaway from boredom and comfort...
