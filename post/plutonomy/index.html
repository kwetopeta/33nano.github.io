<!-- John Adams - There are two ways to conquer and enslave a country. One is by the sword, The other is by debt.


Jacques Chirac (RIP former presidet of France) - "While speaking of Africa, we must check our memory. We started draining the continent four and a half centuries ago with the slave trade. Next, we discovered their raw materials and seized them. Having deprived Africans of their wealth, we sent in our elites who destroyed their culture. Now, we are depriving them of their brains thanks to scholarships which are definitely another form of exploitation because, at the end, the most intelligent students do not go back to their countries […] In the end, noticing that Africa is not in a good state and as bonuses for the wealth we made on its back, we are giving lectures

<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>

<p><del>Darkness is the absence of light and to some literal degree, the abundance of melanin. The topic that&rsquo;s going to be tackled in this essay is one regarding, Afropolitans, citizens of Africa. The essay will draw upon a documentary that piqued my interest on YouTube entitled, The shocking reason why black people are moving to Asia.  No matter where we are geographically, we are still deeply rooted as a bigger picture of the African Diaspora. Afropolitans are human beings who have red blood, a brain and all the systems contained in a human being, but history is devoid of that humanity. Afropolitans have been stripped of their identity, culture, values and to an extreme degree, labeled as monkeys. At the time of writing in 2021, its saddens me that there is a deep divide among Afropolitans. The white mans burden, the ongoing influence of neocolonialism, media portrayal of Africa, the lack of real history (revisionist history is dangerous) and our own ego is getting in the way of progress. Those blood thirsty imperialists have rewritten our history, made us exiles of our own homeland and have turned the mere act and process of living into a game of survival. The rich reservoir of resources that Africa has continues to be exploited, the residue of slavery/ slave mentality has transcended into the workplace and the acts of injustice overt or covert are still taking precedence. Big corporations utilize the vice of arbitrage not only in the continent of Asia, but also in Africa. Afropolitans who found themselves awakening in foreign lands had to fight  because flight was no longer a viable  response/option in order to live, not just survive. All of the sudden an invisible glass ceiling was erected that barred any chances of success, thus only a few have managed to break it and its still there. A glass ceiling that exists in other continents aside from Africa.   From the harsh physical exertions of manual labor, high bank interest rates, segregation, medical experimentation, the list was endless. Afropolitans sacrificed everything to at least be treated as human, but that&rsquo;s a far fetched goal. The mental health of Afropolitans is nonexistent, helpless is a word that exists in their vocabularly, even those who find Catharsis in Christianity question whether God even cares about Afropolitans. How can Afropolitans thrive in a system that is meant to keep them down? Even those that breakthrough still struggle and are unable to break the system. Why do Afropolitans continue fighting a meaningless battle? Those that become enlightened or woke realize that the very act of staying is in of itself  a problem. Planet Earth has 195 countries, why someone would choose to live in a country were they dont feel, treated or even regarded as a human being, i cant comprehend. Reasoning with cynicism i am left to believe that the odds of being an exile, not of ones own country or continent, but planet is a posibility. I would rather not reason with cynicism, but rather consume small increments of the pharmaceutical drug known as <em>optimism</em>. <strong>Optimism</strong> is a pharmaceutical drug in short supply and i believe i just might have found a source that overflows with optimism. With this newfound optimism, I believe Afropolitans have a choice, should they choose to take it. Briefly analyzing history, I found that all accounts of injustice are tied to the colonial languages with <strong>English</strong> being the most prevalent. Countries whose native toungue is English aren&rsquo;t suitable for Afropolitans. I would argue and even point out the most outrageous belief that &ldquo;America is the best country in the world, if you&rsquo;re not Afropolitan.&rdquo;  Afropolitans dont have to participate in the rigged game of survival because they can find true living and be so much more. For those who seek this real opportunity, i believe the East, especially the Continent of <strong>Asia</strong> is a breeding ground for not only Blasians, but also a plethora of possibilities.</del></p>

<!--

When I first watched the documentary, “The SHOCKING Reason Why Black People Are Moving to Asia,” saying that i was shocked would be an understatement. I felt like i was talking to a long distant friend who had found the secret to happiness. Ever since i came to America and having experienced it for what it truly is; My mind was overflowing with questions that I had kept submerged in the back of mind for far too long. Why am i here? Is there anything better? Why do people say its the best country in the world, when it's clearly not? Why does the media suprress the truth about this country? Will I ever get shot? What are the odds of being framed for a crime? Question after question, why do I have these questions when the process of living should be straightforward? Enough! Enough is enough,
recalling all the events of the past and present, I was left to believe that America simply wasn't for me. It was at this time that the quote from the book, Nomad Capitalist, came to me; "Go where you're treated best!" 
 If America isnt hell on Earth, i dont know what is. A 40 minute documentary had provided me with something that i had almost forgotten was possible,travel. Travelling is the same thing that enabled me to realize the uncensored truth and reality of America. My self inflicted limiting paradigm was completely transformed through this video alone. My eyes were opened and shone with a gleam of hope. Hope that i no longer had to live in a survival game, but to truly live life the way God intended it.

<h3 id="video-analysis">Video Analysis</h3>

<!--
The documentary is a compilation of long videos condensed into tiny snippets. The contains However, after watching the documentary I can surely tell that the positives outway the negatives. The first video alone had me hooked when the man being interviewed said " I am a free black man. "
The style of the video is that of a documentary were real people are interviewed and share their stories in the most truthful manner. Every participant traveled from other parts of the globe such as the USA, Canada, Carribean Islands, UK and even Africa. What truly captured me was that the notion and the fact that they said “True freedom exists here, for the first time, I feel like a free man or woman. My mind is at peace and my physical body is at ease.” Those words truly resonated with me because America is a disaster for one's mental health and physical health, especially if you are a black person. To some greater account the spoken word poet, Rudy Francisco, said that "being black in America is an extreme sport." That statement alone inspired this drive for me to break away and start a new life. Of course, I need to develop a skill and plan accordingly because I would just end up as an english teacher or doing other jobs i hate. The other points mentioned in the video are as follows... -->

<li><p>High End Tech - All the fancy stuff without having to wait for it come to the USA years later (cusp of innovation)</p></li>

<li><p>Affordable Cost of Living</p></li>

  Its time for me to strategically plan out and leave before its too late.
America might be the best country in the world, but it's not for me. Why would you leave America? Isn't it Paradise? Are you out of your mind?

To explain America to someone you would have to first teach about the history. All good things start with a history lesson. The history is very painful to learn about, especially as a black person.

What is America. America is a hyperinflated plutonomy, made up of overworked and underpaid dead peasants. A country made up of consumers not citizens. A place filled with blood thirsty imperialists that makes up fake wars. A country that tries to put itself first and rule the world. Money buys laws. 


The Death of American Supremacy and the rise of Eurasia -->

<p><del>Causacasians and  Asians use charity and foreign aid as vices of looting resources, stealing land and enslaving Afropolitans in their own land. Slavery never ended it simply transformed into contracts. Colonialism never ended it simply transformed into a neocolonialist initiative  thats progressed using the brainwashing effects of television to promote the degradation of Afropolitan self image and white supremacy, Foreign aid mascarades independence and hinders innovation. If innovation starts taking place neocolonialists will bribe the broken system of government to revert changes, they dislike Afropolitan success. Afropolitans must remain obedient to their neocolonialist masters and they will do anything to make that happen and it just do happens that money is s powerful medium that would make a person turn against their own family, friends and government.</del></p>

1. **What is a plutonomy?**
- a country or nation ruled by posh people

2. **What crossed your mind to start looking into living abroad?**
- It first started with the problem of education. The reality of higher education being overpriced in America is ridiculous. I always thought in the back of mind, I wouldn't mind studying abroad because you get to learn more, expand your network, immerse yourself in a new culture and its more affordable. For some reason instead of asking how, I found myself looking for true living stories of other Afropolitans. I was already fed up with America to begin with. 

3. **What's the one problem you noticed in the documentary or the channel?**
- Most Afropolitans are English teachers, some start out as ET's while a few never did. I don't want to be an English Teacher, that's just lame. I mean understand the social benefits and it would certainly be easy to grow my network in a foreign land,but I want to dive right into the field of my expertise. Working for someone is unavoidable because work also grants the opportunity to become a resident/sponsorship, but sponsorship is also a double edged sword. 

4. **Why not just work for a company in the USA that will send you abroad?**
- I mean sounds great on paper because you literally get paid US Dollars while living in a foreign country...

5. **Is there really a safe place for Afropolitans?**
- Africa is being neocolonized, America is bloody racist, China is just as worst as the US. 

6. **Is reverse neocolonialism a thing?**
-

7. **Why not just upgrade your mindset and way of thinking instead of fleeing?**
- You can't run away from problems, so why run? True, you can't, but in my defense fleeing to a place with less problems is more bearable as opposed to place with many problems...

8. **Isn't your argument about living in a non English sparking country while making English currency such as the US Dollar & British Pounds?**
- This isn't about money, although its a known fact that the quantity of your currency can directly affect the quality of your lifestyle. A peaceful of mind shouldn't be correlated to money...

9. **If everyone flees who will be left to fix the problems?**
-
