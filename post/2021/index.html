<p>Everyone starts out the new year year with high hopes and expectations. They outline their so called resolutions which are a compass that will enable them to navigate through the year and make the most of it, but only a few succeed or completely abandon their routine. 2021 could have been just another year for me, but something was different or rather I had acquired something that would allow me to change. I knew I was off to a great start when I learned something new, a concept about a personal knowledge management system called a Second Brain. In fact this very site you are reading is styled to reflect my Second Brain. I dived into every single source material that I could find on this idea or mental model of a Second Brain. My excitement was much greater than the time I learned about Mindmapping and speed reading. This time around, I could finally put an end to my weird habit of information hoarding for the sake of intellectual entertainment. I could finally utilize the knowledge that I had been consuming over the past few years and create something out of it. Switching from data consumption to value creation. I read this <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/basb/">article</a> and later watched this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVx22lo9_4">video</a>. <!-- Collecting information does not increase your knowledge, you to need to use it my creating something. After all you only know what you make  --></p>

<h3 id="my-2nd-brain-workflow">My 2nd Brain Workflow</h3>

<p>My second brain workflow goes something like the structure listed below. You can utilize this <a href="https://github.com/33nano/33nano/blob/2nd_Brain/2nd_Brain.md">markdown file</a>  as an example</p>

Your knowledge becomes more practical, not just stagnat as theory. My understanding of this learning management system is essentially creating courses for a large or small scale audience by yourself. Think of it as a DIY udemy, Bitdegree or Teachable course, but instead of hosting it on their platforms, you host it yourself, if you wish to. You have more autonomy and control over courses both artistically and financially. If you wanted to build a gamified course you could easily do it and these learning management systems provide a framework or template if you will. You cant create a gamified course on sites like Udemy, Bitdegree or Teachable. You are stuck with video and whatever limited exercises that are constrained by the platform --></li>

<li><p><strong>What is PARA?</strong></p></li>

<li><p>an acronym that stands for Projects, Areas, Resources and Archive</p></li>

<li><p>Projects are the things you want to do that are associated with a deadline</p></li>

<li><p>Areas are things in your life that demand continuous improvement (self improvement doesn&rsquo;t expire)</p></li>

<li><p>Resources are the sources of content that you consume (podcasts, blogs, articles, courses, videos, songs&hellip;)</p></li>

<li><p>Archive is the the resting place for your completed projects and ideas that you don&rsquo;t know what to do with just yet.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>What is CODE?</strong></p></li>

<li><p>an acronym that stands for Collect, Organize, Distill &amp; Express.</p></li>

<li><p>Collect is the capture habit</p></li>

<li><p>Organize is the knowledge factory, not a library</p></li>

<li><p>Distill is the filter, the unused ideas are archived</p></li>

<li><p>Express is the creative output of the knowledge factory</p></li>

<li><p><strong>How does a Second Brain work?</strong></p></li>

<li><p>It involves 4 simple steps(CODE). You <strong>collect</strong> information by capturing it from whatever source you are consuming or random ideas that just light up in your Brain. You then <strong>organize</strong> that information into your folders (PARA). You then <strong>distill</strong> that information even further by filtering out what you don&rsquo;t need(archive). Finally you <strong>express</strong> everything into some creative output (design, song, blog post, publication, book&hellip;).</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Who is a Second Brain for?</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Everyone (human beings)</p></li>

<li><p>Knowledge workers (developers, researchers, teachers&hellip;)</p></li>

<li><p>Entrepreneurs</p></li>

<li><p>Freelancers</p></li>

<li><p>Content creators</p></li>

<li><p>Productivity enthusiasts</p></li>

<li><p>Self improvement enthusiasts</p></li>

<li><p>Polyglots</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Why build a Second Brain?</strong></p></li>

<li><p>All the knowledge you already have/know will flow, the content you consume will connect and your future self will be in sync. &lt;!&ndash; When a white person says you cant do something you call them a racist, if another black person says it i call it wishful thinking and if in asian person says it&gt;</p></li>

<li><p><strong>What browser extensions/addone</strong> can be used in tandem with a Second Brain?</p></li>

<li><p>Readwise</p></li>

<li><p>Memex</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Are there any rules associated with a Second Brain?</strong></p></li>

<li><p>No rules, its just personal.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Is it possible to create an offline Second Brain?</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Yes, using paper &amp; mind maps</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Are there any medical journals or research papers written on the Second Brain?</strong></p></li>

<li><p>That is something worth looking into&hellip;</p></li>

<li><p><strong>How does a Second Brain minimize regret?</strong></p></li>

<li></li>

<li><h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-a-second-brain-in-academia"><strong>What are the benefits of a Second Brain in academia?</strong></h2></li>

<li><p><strong>If you had discovered about a Second Brain earlier, how would your life have been different?</strong></p></li>

<li><p>I would probably have done way more stuff by now, but dwelling in the past only causes depression. Its best to in the present were you have control - the choice you make and dont make have a direct effect on the quality of your life.</p></li>

<li><h2 id="does-building-a-second-brain-magically-grant-success"><strong>Does building a Second Brain magically grant success?</strong></h2></li>

<li><h2 id="when-you-search-the-term-second-brain-something-about-the-gut-pops-up-are-there-any-similarities-and-distinctions-between-that-and-this-personal-knowledge-management-system"><strong>When you search the term, <em>Second Brain</em>, something about the gut pops up, are there any similarities and distinctions between that and this personal knowledge management system?</strong></h2></li>

<li><p><strong>Which application is best for building a Second Brain?</strong></p></li>

<li><p>The answer is subjective, but at the moment i love Obsidian due to its rescursive search feature, community plugins and graph view. However, i would lean more towards Markor because i can actually use the details tag, unlike Obsidian which forces me to scroll. I believe the answer also depends on your level of computational literacy. Since most of the Second Brain application are open source you can add features your own features where some of these lack. Markor only lacks a recursive search feature and a true AMOLED theme (not even substratum can save me)</p></li>

<li><p><strong>What&rsquo;s the point of building a Second Brain, if the future will be run by robots, AI &amp; automation?</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Unique Human Intelligence is still essential even in the presence of artifical/higher intelligence.</p></li>

<li><h2 id="what-are-some-of-second-brain-styles-you-see-around-the-internet">*What are some of Second Brain styles you see around the internet?**</h2></li>

<li><p><strong>How do you structure your Second Brain?</strong></p></li>

<li><p>I use the PARA method, but the one thing I do different is that for every markdown file I add a details tag at the bottom called Q&amp;A. I believe asking myself questions will help me get to the core of the file that I am looking at, helps with critical thinking and helps with storytelling ( interviews, casual conversation and what not)</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Who can take away your Second Brain from you?</strong></p></li>

<li><p>No one&hellip;</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Do you ommit anything from your Second Brain?</strong></p></li>

<li><p>I believe a Second Brain should be unfiltered and you can write whatever you fâ€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢g want. Just be careful that you don&rsquo;t share it online. Keep it encrypted. Only share what you distil.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>What do you think about using Github or Gitlab as Second Brain?</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Its a great idea, just be sure to keep the repositories private. The only drawback I find is that some of the scripts and HTML tags I add to my markdown don&rsquo;t render because Github has its own markdown flavor. I can&rsquo;t view colors and so forth.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>What can you lose from giving away your Second Brain?</strong></p></li>

<li><p>You give up your ideas, even though it might take someone else time to make sense of your notes</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Whats the best markdown flavor for a Second Brain?</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Whatever flavor allows me to render all HTML tags and scripts. Github flavored markdown is out of the picture</p></li>

<li><p><strong>What&rsquo;s the best not taking file extension for a Second Brain?</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Markdown hands down!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Is using RMarkdown for a Second Brain a viable solution?</strong></p></li>

<li><p>keep it super simple with regular markdown, but feel free to include other file formats for your projects and what not</p></li>

<li><p>*Is Emacs or Vim great for a Second Brain?**</p></li>

<li><p>That&rsquo;s a matter of personal preference</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Can you get in trouble for having a Second Brain?</strong></p></li>

<li><p>You cant get in trouble for what the eyes of others cannot see. Its personal just like your toenails</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Why did you learn latin?</strong></p></li>

<li><p>I got bored of using an English dictionary to look up words</p></li>

<li><p><strong>What do you think about Unknown P?</strong></p></li>

<li><p>His style of music is just different. Its comical just like Big Shaq&rsquo;s music, lyrically and well annunciated as Epic Rap Battles of History. Overall his music style though its considered posh drill, i would rather call it intellectual music. You learn something by listening to his music and you feel intellectually energizes, as opposed to being numbed by the mumbles and dumb lyrics of other music types&hellip;</p></li>

<li><p><strong>What would you say is the most crucial thing you learned this year as opposed to last?</strong></p></li>

<li><p><em>It takes value creation to make money</em> - TK Coleman. I could have that on repeat whole day. Value is what drives the human world. Value creates even more value for people and in return monetary value in the form of fiat or cryptocurrency comes pouring in like rain in your wallet.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>What is the most interesting thing you learned this year?</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Learning about planned obsolesence got me thinking, i even wrote an essay on it to explore the title even more. Planned obsolesence is just plain evil, no wonder its outlawed, but its still practiced&hellip;</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Does collecting information increase your knowledge</strong>?</p></li>

<li><p>No, thats a false claim. The act of merely collecting information alone does not make you smart or more knowledgeable. The argument could be made about people who have massive collections and shels of book, ie Tai Lopez, but that doesnt meant they are smart.
