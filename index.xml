      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t pinpoint the exact date, but I was listening to Gregorian Chants, while working on something. In the heat of the moment, I though to myself, &amp;lsquo;this would pretty cool with some rain sounds in the background.&amp;rsquo; I should have just dismissed the thought then, but my curiosity got the best of me. The next steps were visibly clear, I simply needed to download the soundtracks and combine them with Audacity.</description>

      <description>Comfort and Laziness have been my longest business partners, since the dawn of time. This site looks empty because Hugo is generous enough to have a draft = true Front Matter. In the meantime, I made some super cool placeholder titles and I&amp;rsquo;ll leave you with this awesome art manifesto by Austin Kleon -
