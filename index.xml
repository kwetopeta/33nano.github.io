      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t pinpoint the exact date, but I was listening to Gregorian Chants, while working on something. In the heat of the moment, I though to myself, &amp;lsquo;this would pretty cool with some rain sounds in the background.&amp;rsquo; I should have just dismissed the thought then, but my curiosity got the best of me. The next steps were visibly clear, I simply needed to downloaded the soundtracks and combine them with Audacity.</description>

      <description>Comfort and Laziness have been my longest business partners, since the dawn of time. This site looks empty because Hugo is generous enough to have a draft = true Front Matter. In the meantime, I made some super cool placeholder titles and I&amp;rsquo;ll leave you with this awesome art manifesto by Austin Kleon -
Draw the art you want to see, start the business you want to run, play the music you want to hear, write the books you want to read, build the products you want to use â€“ do the work you want to see done.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my Blog! My name is Prince Kaizen Namwali, an Afropolitan from the warm heart of Africa ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¼. I am a Lifelong Learner, Digital Nomad &amp;amp; Game Dev. Whats my story?
My story has a fuzzy timeline, but its safe to say that it started with a course, that I purchased on Udemy, entitled REBT The Science of Programming Your Mind, which can be found right here. Till this day, I can vividly recall the details of that course and continue to experience the positive impact that its had.</description>
