      <article class="main"><p>Necessity is the mother of invention, but it all starts with a question. Is this the only way? What do i need that the currently available options don&rsquo;t provide? How can we change this? Why? How come? Is there a better way? How can this be improved? What if? And the list of questions goes on and on.</p>
<p>Necessity is behind why we search for information on the internet. You could be looking for the definition of a word, a code solution on stack overflow, more information about a person or just about anything you are curious about. Necessity can be driven by curiosity, frustration, longing for something better, a new and improved solution or a remix of something exisiting. As a lifelong learner, i am drawn to a multitude of examples, but in this post i will only cover the ones what i find intriguing and explore some questions of my own.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Is it possible to make a music video using a game engine?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Yes! One of the best examples is the music video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szrDcTGvp7o">Rainfall</a> by Stormzy and this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm8v9z28PYY">video</a> goes behind the scenes. The graphics are absolutely gorgeous and it got me thinking just how awesome the idea of using a game engine to make music videos. Game engines are primarily used for creating games, but when I look around I see a multitude of possibilites from the plugins developers create to extend the functionality of a game engine.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>How can i automate the process  of clearing metadata from my Android phone without having to do it manually?</strong></li>

<li><strong>What would T-UI launcher look like, if it was complete?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ohi.andre.consolelauncher">T-UI Launcher</a> is the best minimal launcher on Android because it features a fully functional and simple command line interface</li>

<li><strong>Is it possible to make Tachiyomi an eBook reader, while still keeping its main functionality of reading comics?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi">Tachiyomi</a> is the best application for reading Manga, Manhwa, Manhua, Webcomics and Comics, but i feel that it is still incomplete. I</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>What problems does television solve?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I can&rsquo;t posibly think of any reason or problem television solves. When i ask this question, i am not questioning the hardware, but traditional television. Television as a hardware serves a great purpose for external devices like a Shield TV (Android TV), gaming consoles&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>What problems does Game Development solve?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Being a game developer is one of those revered careers, but when i began to ponder i couldn&rsquo;t find any reason why a person would become a game developer. Anyone can make a video game with out without code, heck the easist type of game to make is a visual novel and its basically the same as a powerpoint. Alright you spent a year or more to create your first ever indie game, but have you solved? If people keep using the same approach to making video games, i dont think&hellip; Observe the masses and do the opposite, but everyone wants to do the same thing as the massess. I believe the beauty of gamification is being wasted on creating addictive mobile games/ video games that contain no value. I believe using gamification as a means for things like Neuroscience, learning and real world problems is a step in the right path, but how many people are doing it?</li>
</ul>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>Is it possible to keep up with TV content without watching TV?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>TV is a waste of time, but it almost seems like in order to remain a high functioning sociable member of society you must pledge your alliance to some show or medium that presents itself on TV. One of the programs people love to exchange their precious time for is TV shows, whether is its animated or portays real human beings. When i first had this question, i was aware of a service by the name <a href="https://www.vidangel.com/">VidaAngel</a>, a service that enables consumers the ability to filter out scenes which you wish not to see in movies or any TV show. My astonishment with using Vidangel allowed me to question, what if? What if you could skip watching TV altogether and still be in the so called zone of awareness? This would save you precious time and the detrimental effects of blue light devouring your optic nerves. The bigger challenge is answering the how? Isnt human intervention ncessary? What are the odds of summaries being biased?&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong>Is it possible to write an eBook on Android?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>All you need to create an eBook on desktop is <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">markdown</a> and <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>, but thats currently not possible on Android&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong>How can i sync my markor notes with Obsidian?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Markor is by far the best markdown editor on Android because it has no limitations and then comes Obsidian, one of the best markdown editors on desktop. These two applications are great for building a Second Brain, but syncing notes between the two is a hassle&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<ol start="10">
<li><strong>Is cloud mining and hardware mining the only way to mine cryptoccurency?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<ol start="11">
<li><strong>Is it possible to make Wolfram Tone Generator function offline?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>One of the best music generators aside from <a href="https://aiva.ai/">AIVA</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/magenta/magenta">Magenta</a> is <a href="https://tones.wolfram.com/">Wolfram Tone Generator</a></li>
</ul>
<ol start="12">
<li><strong>Is it possible to procedurally generate Gregorian chants?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<ol start="13">
<li><strong>Is it possible to communicate through EEG Headsets/devices?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>An Electroencephalogram is a test that detects the electrical activity of the Brain using various devices/headsets that contain electrodes which are then administered to the scalp. The most popular consumer based EEG device is the Muse Headbands by <a href="https://choosemuse.com/">Interaxon</a> and it has a good track usage record. EEG devices aren&rsquo;t limited to just reading electrical activity of the Brain, throughout my searching i have unique use cases including creating music, real time visual mind reading&hellip; The one thing i havent found information on is using EEG devices as a means of communication between other human beings&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<ol start="14">
<li><strong>What would it take to build a decentralized application that icentivizes people who watch television?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Watching TV is waste of time, but i digress. What if we could change the narrative of TV and make it worthwhile? What if we could apply the same logic of <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave&rsquo;s</a> <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">Basic Attention Token</a> (BAT) to TV?&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<ol start="15">
<li><strong>What would a virtual fitting room look like?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The good thing about shopping offline at a clothing store is that the consumer has the added advantage of a physical fitting room. In a fitting room the consumer can directly found out the appropriate clothing size and also the clothing appearance. With a physical fitting room you dont need to visualize the appearance of the clothing in your hand because you can make it a reality and decide whether or not your choice actually suites you. The disadvantage of shopping for clothes online is that there is a limit to ones visualization. Just because you think you would look cool wearing those clothes doenst gracefully translate in reality. Visualization is a problem and the need is a clear indicator, a mirror of sorts. This is were i propose a cool idea of a virtual fitting room. With the advancements in Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Mixed Reality (MR) and Extended Reality (XR), i believe its possible. Imagine for a second, creating a 3D model of yourself, think of it as your <a href="https://en.gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a>, but optimized for shopping. This 3D Gravatar would function as your mirror, instead of the relying on the imperfect mirror of visualization. If the clothes are too big or too small the changes you see would be a direct reflection of that&hellip;.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="16">
<li><strong>Is it possible to use GDScript as a scripting language outside of the Godot Game Engine?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>GDScript is a beautiful scripting language and the list of example apps that showcase its beauty, countless. However, i believe GDScript as it is would be a great addition to applications that utilize other languages like Lua. GDScript would be great for adding gamification features to regular programs like Gimp, Aseprite, Inkscape and so many more&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<ol start="17">
<li><strong>Is there a mind mapping program that follows the Tony Buzan Style?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Throughout my exploring on the internet i have been unable to find a mind mapping program that follows the Tony Buzan style. The closest i ever got was <a href="https://www.ayoa.com/mind-mapping/software/">Ayoa</a> , but even that is limited. Hand drawn mind maps are just better overall, even though they take more time than digital versions&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<ol start="18">
<li><strong>Whats the solution to prevent and completely stop gun violence?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The USA is a warzone of racial wars,income inequality, gun violence, gender inequality, expensive healthcare, but yet they boast of being the best country in the world (irony). Perhaps one the biggest problems in the USA is gun violence&hellip; The statistics of gun violence in the USA are wild with more than 30K deaths reported anually. I once thought about a radical solution while digesting yet another shooting incident headline that happened in the year 2015, Charleston, South Carolina&hellip; My radical proposal is for a way to track guns in real time, but thats absurd&hellip; What about ghost guns? How the heck do you even track guns? A metal detector with a wide range that can differetiate between regular metal and the specific metallic composition of a gun? You must be absurd? You are definitely living in a fantasy? Who are you to even write about guns? I am aware its a large topic, but the facts that its something you cant avoid means its a problem worth addressing&hellip;</li>
